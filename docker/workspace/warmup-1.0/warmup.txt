Warmup assignment: running the sample programs
-----------------------------------

Download the binaries for Windows or compile from source on
Linux and Mac OS. Make sure this is your working directory
when you run the Lua executable, so it will find all the
libraries it needs.

Then, try to run the sample programs to produce the images
in the "results/" directory.
